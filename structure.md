# Community structure

The community is very loose and has limited structure.

We are growing management and community governance roles and adding structure to support
the scale of our community.

At present, the structure is ad hoc, but could best be described as:

## "the board"

The group of 25 or so people who started Tech For Palestine. While the
board has no formal role (like the rest of the org, everything is very loose),
management consults with the board on new policy and reports back periodically
to ensure we are on the right track.

The board discusses things in a private channel called #the-board.

## Management

A group of 5-7 people, who show up daily for management meetings. We
concern ourselves with scaling the organization and community to support the mission.
This is informal, but decisions are made quickly and communicated to the management team
and community.

Community members can discuss the management of the community in #policy-discuss.

Management works in #management-public (publicly visible), #management-private (secret), and
#moderation-private (secret).

## Project leaders

Leaders of official, community, and external projects are all referred to as Project leaders.
They communicate with each other and management in #project-leaders-public (publicly visible)
and #project-leaders-private.

## "Roles"

We are currently "hiring" volunteers to scale the organization, which we currently call "roles".
We do not have the 

## Official projects

An official project can be created from community projects, external projects, or other work
which matches our mission. It should:
- address our mission directly, or help significantly with it
- have known maintainers (who can be anonymous) commit to it for an appropriate length of time,
  as well as commiting to sunset it after that time if appropriate
- be responsive to feedback from the board and management if there is
  misalignment
- adhere to our code of conduct

To request a project become an official project, project owners should post in #policy-discuss
addressing the questions above. Note that we can provide support to projects, including external
partners, without needing to be an official project. We are all on the same team.

## Community projects

Community projects are created by members of the community, and incubated by Tech
For Palestine. Some may become Official Projects if they match the criteria and ask 
to become Official projects. Community projects have a very low bar for creation, and
do not have to pass any of the rules to potentially be official projects (they must
of course adhere to our code of conduct).

## External partners

External partners refer to anyone in the broader Palestinian advocacy
movement who wants to set up a small home or outpost in our Discord server,
so that they may take advantage of our community. Partners use this to tell
people about their work, to get volunteers (especially for technical work),
or to meet other parts of the community.

Any pro-Palestinian organization may join and get a channel set up or post ads
for volunteers, so long as they are not opposed to our mission or values, and 
adhere to the code of conduct.
