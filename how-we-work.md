# Mission

The mission of Tech for Palestine is to shift the "Overton window" - the range of acceptable
conversation - about Palestine in the US-based/Silicon-Valley-based tech scene. In particular,
we seek to humanize Palestinians and people in Palestine.

We run projects and initiatives aimed at advocating for Palestine and Palestinians, where they
can help change minds in tech. These include content-based, advocacy-based, and leverage-based
projects.

We believe in taking many shots, and investing in ones that take off. We support the community
to build new ideas, draw attention and help launch existing work, and provide support to other
initiatives that need technical help.

## Overton window shift

At the pro-Israel end of the spectrum, we want to help convert overtly genocidal conversations
and extreme pro-Israel bias which is supporting amd whitewashing the genocide and occupation 
and oppression of the Palestinian people, into statements supporting peace and unity between 
the two groups.

On the pro-Palestinian end of the spectrum, we want to enable people concerned about the occupation,
genocide, settlements, apartheid, and other Israeli oppression of Palestine, to speak up.

## Specific tech focus

We are very deliberately focused on changing the US-based tech scene (and within that, mostly but not
exclusively the startup/investor segment).

Our focus on the US is not only because the US has supported Israel through its occupation, 
oppression, and genocide in Palestine, but because it is the US support that enables these actions,
including arming Israel, and the US which vetoes UN actions which could end the genocide.

Tech is a powerful part of the US narrative, and helping change people's opinions in tech helps
change the overall narrative.

## Startup projects

Most of our projects are intended to be run as startups: validating ideas, doing customer and
product discovery, building minimal viable products and iterating to find product-market fit,
and then scaling.

## Scope of projects

Our mission supports projects that are one-degree removed from the core mission, as these often
boost and support the core mission, so long as they are connected to changing minds in the US-based
tech scene in some -- possibly creative -- way. One degree removed means that if it involves Palestine
and tech, For example, a project to raise money for Palestinian startups is conencted to mission because 
it's the tech community helping Palestine, and it affords to opportunity to get the US-based tech scene 
talking about, and publicly discussing investments in Palestine.

## Limits to projects

There are many ways to change hearts and minds, and we are not particularly picky. If it works, it works. 
Projects that go against standard narratives, such as broader boycotts than the traditional BDS movement,
are fine. Initiatives that are against Israel (such as boycotts of Israeli tech, or fighting Israeli
propaganda) are fine.

We have a strong code of conduct and moderation, and do not allow projects or individuals in the community
who are advocating violence or anti-semitism.
