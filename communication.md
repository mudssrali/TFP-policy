# Communication

Most of our communication targets people who are not decided on the
Palestinian cause. As such, we must target our language to allow them
to take up our cause, and not alienate them.

## Be respectful

We should always endeavor to refer to people in a way that is respectful 
to their beliefs and identity. For example, "pro-Israel" is appropriate, 
whereas for example "zio" is not.

### Be extremely careful around anti-semitism

While it is common for Israel to call people anti-semitic when they merely disagree with
Israeli policy and actions, it is possible that genuine anti-semitism may occur in our 
community. This must absolutely not be tolerated.

We do not know or and cannot vouch for all the people in our community or all the
things they say, and some of them may in fact say anti-semitic things - not every
accusation will be wrong. In these cases we must act quickly to remove any 
anti-semitism from our community. Our Code of Conduct describes this in more detail.

In addition, it is possible for wording to get confused and to imply anti-semitism 
where none is intended. We must be extremely careful about our wording, and correct
it quickly if mistakes are made.

### Referring to Jewish people

Anti-semitism refers to attacks on Jewish people, but since our community is
concerned about the actions of the Israeli government and military, we should have
little need to speak about Judaism or Jewish people.

However, in the occasional situation where we are discussing Judaism or Jewish people,
we must be extremely respectful. Primarily, in US English, "Jewish people" is the
appropriate term for Jewish people, not "Jews" (unless you are yourself a Jewish person).

Translations (including software translations) from other languages may incorrectly
reference Jewish people instead of Israelis. People for whom English is a second language,
or people from outside the US, may also be in the habit of confusing these terms. We must
be careful not to allow this to slip by.

### Avoid the word "Zionist" if possible

Though Zionist is the correct technical term for people who promote Zionism,
the exact meaning of the term is not extremely widespread, and may not be known
by the people we wish to target with our message.

Using the term "Zionism" or "Zionist" may seem to those people as anti-semitism,
as most -- at least in the US -- will only recognize the term as being used by white
supremacists and other anti-semites.

Thus, we avoid this term where possible, even if it leads to less clear language.
We recommend "pro-Israel" instead.
